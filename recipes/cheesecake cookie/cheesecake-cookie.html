        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>For filling, mix softened cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Scoop filling into small balls and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract; beat until smooth and fluffy</li>
            <li>Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in flour, cinnamon, and baking soda just until flour disappears.</li>
            <li>In a separate shallow bowl stir 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together for the cinnamon sugar.</li>
            <li>Scoop cookie dough by 2 tablespoonfuls and flatten into a circle with your hands. Place a ball of cream cheese filling in the center of the cookie dough. Press cookie dough up and around filling, sealing filling inside.</li>
            <li>Roll each cookie dough ball into the cinnamon sugar mixture and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just turning golden on the bottom and the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
